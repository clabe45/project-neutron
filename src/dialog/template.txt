This is where I get off kid.
I'm supposed to speak a bit?
Each line is a box of dialog.

[MC]
And the box up top?

[Hammer]
It tells the program who's speaking.
The idea is that we split it by \n
Then we loop through
If it's a [], we load the portrait
If not, and the line ain't empty
We load the text into the box!
