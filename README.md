## Project Neutron
This is a side-scrolling platformer made in **love2d**. The master branch contains "safe" code that should run flawlessly in LOVE, while the dev branch contains experimental and potentially buggy code.

## Contributing
This project is not currently open to public contributions. At the moment, I am the sole developer of the project, with more potentially being added later on.

## Running
The project is unable to be ran locally, as the assets are not packaged in this repository. All code required to run the project (the .lua files) are present. The code in this repository is for curiosity and learning, along with a way to get an idea of the code behind this project.

## Future Plans
This is simply a hobby project I'm making for fun. I'll slowly develop it day-by-day and see what comes of it. If you're curious as to the in-depth work I'm doing on it, I've written numerous articles over on my [blog](https://taizweb.github.io/blog).
