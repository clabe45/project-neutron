## Testgame (v2)
This is a side-scrolling platformer made in **love2d**. The game has currently been in development for two years, with about 4 months of actual work being done on it. The master branch contains "safe" code that should run flawlessly in LOVE, while the dev branch contains experimental and potentially buggy code.

## Contributing
This project is not currently open to public contributions. At the moment, I am the sole developer of the project, with more potentially being added later on.
